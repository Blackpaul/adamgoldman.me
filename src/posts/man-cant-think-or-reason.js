I've seen that talk and processed it every time at a different level. It's one of those multi-layered communication examples which I enjoy so much.

I'd LOVE to hear your thoughts about that, good, bad, and everything in between.

I suggest you DO NOT take notes the first time you watch this, immerse yourself in the experience, and [let's talk](/lets-talk/).
