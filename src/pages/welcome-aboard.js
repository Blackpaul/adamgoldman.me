So ...
You decided to join our little circle eh?

Smart move my friend ;)

**Expect me to knock on your virtual door** every once in a while, **cool stuff guaranteed**. In the meantime, anything else [you want to say](/lets-talk/)?

btw, one of my virtual minions might have sent you a quick email to make sure we got the address right, and that you want to get more from [me](/who-am-i-anyway/).
