The \"11\" interventions are powerful on their own, but it's not as powerful as me doing this entire session as one long induction, in which I clearly set the frame of me having control and that as long as she continues to do what I say, her problems WILL be over, and there's just no two ways to go about it.\n\nI will write a dedicated post for frame control later on, but for now just notice the ongoing \"tone\" I'm setting here.\n\nThis is something I'm harping on with many of my students and colleagues. The client needs to KNOW and feel ONE HUNDRED PERCENT that there's just no way I'm going to let her stay the same way. It's just not an option.\n\nLet's begin ...\n\nRight out the gate she preframes our work for me:  \n**JB**: *My dad once said to me as a child the mind has great control over the body when I was poorly as a youngster. I'm willing to try anything.*\n\nand continues to give much information about her past:  \n**JB**: *I was bullied, raped, excluded from friendship, labled a lier, my dad had a heart attack. Quite a bit around that time*\n\n### Intervention #1 - Relieving memory of the rape at 15\nI ask her to choose the first thing she wants to work on, in a very specific way, the highly presuppoes success. I come off so strong since she already said she will try anything AND the she has a deep belief from childhood about the power of the \"mind\":\n\n**AG**: *so let's start with something simple*  \n*... Think about one memory that **still** bothers you* - presupposing it won't in the future  \n*... and you will feel better now that you are about to learn to feel better about it* - embedded command (feel better now), followed by another presupposition she will solve this (you are about to learn) and another embeded comman (feel better about it) \n\nShe chooses the rape and the accusations of \"asking for it / lying\":  \n**JB**: *I'll start with the lier thing. That hurt more than the trauma in some ways. Craving support and help when people turned their backs and supported the person who attacked me. Remember sitting by a lake feeling desperate. Writing poems and trying to make sense of it all I feel so bad for that girl.*\n\nNotice she ends with dissociation (*I feel so bad for that girl*), and I enforce that:\n\n**AG**: *that's good you have this separation* - Enforcing and pacing where she is now  \n*... it means the hard part u've already done on your own,* - Presupposing SHE has the power AND it's gonna be a smooth sailing from here  \n*... without even realizing* - this is a seed for later on, to warm her up to the idea she has more power than she is aware of.  \n*... let's first only focus on the attack itself okay?* - This is not a must, and I could have opt for processing the rape AND the social judging, which I usually do in face to face sessions.\n\nI then have her use do the [trauma relief](/tools/trauma-relief/) [tool](/tools/) on just the rape incident itself. At the time the [tool](/tools/) was \"in diapers\", and didn't include some important framing, so I walked her thru that myself.\n\nSuccess was evident:\n\n**JB**: *Blimy, that's very interesting! The colour I got was very significant*  \n*... Certain moments flashed back* - Indicating the brain learned a better process than repressing those moments  \n*... Saw his intent from the start which I have never seen before* - These kinds of spontaneous conclusions often happen when shifting perceptual positions  \n*... And then when I focused on how I felt after I felt good from in my chest. And It felt green like fresh morning grass. Bright as a green go sign. Positive and new. Which feels good. But very strange.*\n\nNo matter how many times I've done this, I'm always amazed when someone learns to actually feel GOOD about something that just a few minutes ago was percieved as severe trauma.\n\n**AG**: *now as you think about that same memory again how do you feel? what's different?* - presupposing something IS different\n\n**JB**: *Yes very strange. I feel good. Its like it wasn't what it was?*\n\n**AG**: *do you want me to revert you back to your old feelings?*\n\n**JB**: *No way lol I like this*\n\nBy saying \"no\" to this seemingly obvious question, she unconsciously accepts 3 presuppositions that the problem is in the past:\n- revert\n- back\n- old feelings\n\nAnd there's also another (MUCH more impactful) presupposition she accepts here, that all this is HER FEELINGS, meaning it's not about the event itself, it's her reaction to the event.\n\nThis is what many spiritual teachers try to pass on to their students, usually with limited results since they offer it cognitively, which [I have not found](/blog/what-we-are-not-doing/) to be as powerful.\n\nNow compare it to what she's experiencing here ...\n\nShe's in a profound altered state. She's actually feeling good thinking about the memory of her being raped at age 15, which most people couldn't comprehend without proper training. She went from 23 years of trauma, straight into good feelings in less than 10 minutes, and here I am asking her if she wants to go back to the way it was.\n\nSince her Amygdala is hyper active, and she's juiced up with all these emotions, any learning that takes place will be highly impactful and long lasting.\n\nAnd of course she will say no to this seemingly obvious question, thus accepting all those presuppositions straight into the unconscious and long term memory.\n\nSneaky stuff eh? ;)\n\nI use it a LOT which is DEVESTATINGLY powerful, and if you work with people in this way, PLEASE DO IT as well.\n\nIt also adds to the playfulness and easy-going-ness of the overall interaction, which is always good. Some people think changes should be \"serious\", long, and painful. That hasn't been my experience.\n\n### Intervention #2 - Building want and anticipation for the future\nI leverage  that state to build want and anticipation towards a brighter future after the \"condition\" will be \"cured\", using hypnotic patterns.\n\n**AG**: *ha! Isn't it interesting*  \n*I wonder if you already begin to wonder*  \n*how curious you become now*  \n*as you think of this moment*  \n*not too far from now*  \n*where you already learned how to turn more and more things*  \n*that used to bother you*  \n*to this new*  \n*pretty incredible feeling*  \n*comical even*  \n*how awesome is that?*  \n\nSome of what's going on in this part:\n- I start with a question (isn't it interesting) and continue to a packed statement\n- Compounding open ended possibilities to overload her cognitive mind\n- *wonder* - sementically packed word, implying childhood, fairy tales and playfullness. Also sounds like \"wander\", which adds to the open endedness.\n- *as you think of this moment* - double meaning, could be now or as connected to the next sentence, \"not too far rom now\"\n- *where you already learned* - presupposing she is about to learn, it's only a matter of time, AND that it's something to be learned, and not some \"condition\" from the outside\n- *used to bother you* - presupposing it won't bother her in the future\n- *to this new pretty incredible feeling* - double meaning, \"this\" could refer to her current feeligns or the future ones\n- *how awesome is that* - presupposing the future WILL be positive, and it's just a matter of HOW positive she can make it\n\n**JB**: *It is very awesome. And I didn't think it would be possible.*\n\nThis is gold. There are many ways to change and install operational positive beliefs, which I will dedicate a post about in the future.\n\nBy far, I've found the simplest way to do so is thru impactful direct experince, like turning what seemed to be traumatic, to a source of strength.\n\nI proceed to stack more positivity towards the future:\n\n**AG**: *did you know you are going to feel so good about this* - pointing out again how she can feel good without expecting it  \n*just a few moments ago* - Pointing out the polarity between how she \"just was\" before to how she feels now  \n*I wonder what else you can begin to wonder, as you wander around these good feelings, about what it is that is possible for you now, that you know what you know*\n\nIn that last sentence there are a few things going on. I'm inviting her unconsciously to generate possibilities about the future WHILE FEELING GOOD, and presupposing again SHE IS IN CONTROL (\"*now that you know what you know*).\n\nI've found one of the ways peole so successfully get themselves in a rot is thinking about the future while feeling bad and powerless, which is a good way to make sure you make bad decisions, which induce more bad feelings, and so it goes ...\n\nShe responds rather positively:\n\n**JB**: *And I've tried so many times to play it back, make sense of it. See whether I did make it happen if it was my fault. If I remember it right. To suddenly feel this way is incredible ... And yes. The possibilities now seem quite wonderous ... It's a wonderful feeling Adam. Like you say not only a feeling though. It's like a liberation and excitement cause the possibilities of this are pretty endless! You have found something here I believe. Thank you!*\n\nLater that day she reports interesting progress ...\n\n**JB**: *Dunno how or why but I have a spring in my step. My minds working fast. I feel excited. This is highly unusual for me. I'm often bed bound feeling like I'm dying. Today has been a good day. If your about I'll message tomorrow 🙂 thank you again.*\n\n\n### Intervention #3 - Relieving memory of finding dead godfather\n\nI first make sure to separate potential grief from the traumatic experience itself, then prcoeed to relief the trauma.\n\n**JB**: *Next one that comes to mind is finding my god father dead at my home while I was caring for him.*\n\n**AG**: *there are two different things in here ... do you miss him also? and have feelings of loss when you think of him?*\n\n**JB**: *No. He abused me as a child.*\n\nEven tho she points to the abuse, that does not mean there's no caring, and since I'm not there to read her non-verbal cues and tonality, I make one more check with slight humor:\n\n**AG**: *so that's mainly the memory itself of seeing him dead? you don't go like \"poor god father ... I wish he would still be with me\"*\n\n**JB**: *There's a lot of mixed up feelings. I cared. But I don't feel loss.*\n\n**AG**: *okay so run the same process*\n\n...\n\n**JB**: *I had to do that twice. Didn't work first time. But I feel good now 🙂*\n\nThis is a great indicator of her taking control over her life. Most people would not do it again, and instead tell me something like \"it didn't work\", expecting me to solve the situation for them.\n\n**AG**: *excellent so now when you think of that memory, what happens? any of the old feeling left?*\n\nAlways stacking presuppositions, it's HER FEELING that matters, not the sitation itself, AND these are old feelings.\n\n**JB**: *No. No old feeling. I feel good. All I can think of is me comically jumping throwing tea in the air*\n\n**AG**: *LOL*\n\n**JB**: *I was holding a tray of tea and toast lol*\n\n**AG**: *wasted a good tea? AND a toast? have you no shame? what a terrible loss!*  \n{Laughing out sticker here}  \n*u mentioned he abused you? notice what happens as you think of that now*  \n*u might still need to do the proces* - presupposing it's either resolved or on the way for being resolved\n*or is it 100% automatic already?* - again presupposing it's either totally autoamtic or on the way for being so\n\n**JB**: *Oh actually you're right. It's like that was nothing?*\n\n**AG**: *lol I think you're broken :P* - more silliness\n\n**JB**: *Lol Oops. Sorry not sorry lol* - she goes along with it\n\n**AG**: *u sure you don't want me to revert you back to your old behaviors? lol* - you know the impact of this by now ;)\n\nAt this point the rest of her past traumas \"flipped\" to good feelings, as her brain generalized the learning. This is one of faster cases I encountered of someone learning so fast to generalize changes in this magnitude.\n\n**AG**: *try to find any experiences* - try presupposes failure  \n*that **used** to bother you* - presupposes it's in the past  \n*before what you learned* - it's all about knowing what to do, not the experiences themselves  \n*notice what happens we want to be thorough here 🙂*\n\n**JB**: *Everything feels much better. How strange.*\n\n**AG**: *lol you really have no idea how much more is on the way* - building more desire and curiousity for a brighter future\n\n**JB**: *It's kinda freaky. But it's good*\n\n**AG**: *it is, isn't it?*\n\nNotice how I keep the frame of \"everything is great\" even tho she uses words that could go either way like \"how strange\" and \"it's kinda freaky\". Like I said in the intro, the client needs to know that no matter what happens, she WILL get better.\n\n### Intervention #4 - Intensify good feelings\nSent her to do the [good feelings generator](/tools/feel-good-generator/).\n\n**JB**: *Got interrupted by the door twice pfft. So took me a while to get back in the zone but I persisted. That was really good! I chose excitement.* - This is brilliant. Julliane's initiative and proactivity are quite remarkable. She won't let anything stand in her way, and that's exactly where you want clients to be.\n\n*It's a good motivator. And when you feel so low on energy and in pain it's so hard to get motivated. So I wanted more 🙂* - Another great sign. her lack of motivation actually motivated her to want more. She connected the tool on her own to the solution to low energy and pain.\n\n### Intervention #5 - Relieving anxiety\n\n**AG**: *did you tell me about panic / anxiety? not sure if it was you*  \nI was working with about a dozen of people at the time, from depression, OCD and fibro groups, so wasn't sure who told me about what.\n\n**JB**: *i suffered badly with depression about a year ago, with anxiety and feelings of panic.*\n\n**AG**: *so right now can you feel anxiety?* - presupposing it's something SHE CAN DO, she has the power.\n\n**JB**: *I can push it away feeling the way I do at the moment*\n\nThis is an attempt on her part to get over the anxiety which most people do. Because she is not conscious of HOW she generates the anxiety, she tries to overcome it by pushing \"it\" away. Probably \"it\" means she is pushing away the picture in her mind that makes her anxious. This provides some momentarily relief, but it's not a long term solution, so I elicit her internal strategy for making the anxiety:\n\n**AG**: *is it a picture in your mind of something? teach me how to make this feeling so do I need to make a picture of myself? or I say stuff to myself?*\n\nNotice also this elicitation presupposes again that this is something she is DOING, as oppose to something that just happens to her.\n\nShe describes a vivid internal movie, so I have her run the [trauma relief tool](/tools/trauma-relief/) on it, which works the same way on constructed scenarios.\n\n**JB**: *it's like bright lights of good stuff coming out from where I expected something awful to come from*\n\n**AG**: *bright lights of good stuff lol I created an ecstasy junkie! how will I live with myself 😞oh lord, pardon me for my sins ...*\n\nI add more playfullness and silliness, and continue to solidify the change:\n\n**AG**: *so no more anxiety? are you going to miss it?*\n\nBy saying \"no\", she unconsciously accepts the presupposition the anxiety does not exist in her future. This is a covert way of future pacing by implication, which very rarely get resistance.\n\n**JB**: *No. Thinking about how it goes just gets scrambled by pleasure and I feel good. Mental*\n\n**AG**: *lol you were suppose to teach me how to get panic* - solidifying the idea she was always in control, actively making the panic  \n*not turn it into more good feelings!* - presupposing there are more good feelings other than this one  \n*I'm gonna have to give you an \"F\" in brain control* - more silliness\n\n\n### Intervention #6 - Turning all negativity to good feelings\n**AG**: \"so thinking of anxiety make you feel good now huh how about depression? don't tell me that's gone too??\" - more laughter and silliness\n\n**JB**: *It's hard to think about anything negative right now? I feel good 🙂*\n\n**AG**: *that's exactly the time to try in vain to feel bad* - double presupposition she will fail (\"try\", \"in vain\")  \n*think of stuff that used to make you feel bad in the past* - double presupposition it's in the past (used to, in the past)\n\n**JB**: *Lol it's not working. You broke the button for me.*\n\n**AG**: *this is the perfect time to connect more good feelings to old limitations worst case scenario you will find more things to turn into bright lights of pleasure*\n\nNotice how I set it up as a positive double bind. I have her make a thorough scan of her past, with the KNOWING that no matter what she will \"find\" in this internal scan, it's positive.\n\nUp until the day before she was being ruled by her past, and now she is jumping into it HOPING to find more bad feelings to turn into good ones. This is powerful as it is sneaky, and it's one of the learnings I install in most my clients and students.\n\n**JB**: *Same things happening to most stuff. They are many wavy lines of light moving towards me from the thing/situation I'm thinking about all different colours.* - This is a fantastic reaction. She's already in light synsteshia.\n\n**AG**: *and many wavy lights moving towards you ... and different colours!* - clean hypnotic language to intensify her experience  \n*I wonder if u've thought what colorful lights can smell like or perhaps you already hear the sound they do, and the sound of the feeling?* - eliciting synsteshia of sound and/or smell\n\n**JB**: *Hmm smell of burning incense silent and fast* - that's impressive! she got smell, sound and speed\n\n**JB**: *... It's all turned into pleasure. What did you do hahahaha I could sit here and do this all day 😛* - seems like it's working :)\n\n\n### Intervention #7 - Recoding life with the new good feeling\nI have her intensify the feeling while going to her earliest memory, and go through her entire life with this feeling, and stack any good feeling she finds along the way.\n \n**JB**: *All went by in quick moving smoky journey. Stopping at stages filling each up the same feeling.*  \n*I actually found myself gasping at some points*  \n*lol*  \n*mental*  \n*How can my Brain do this.*  \n\n\n### Intervention #8 - Future pacing / recoding rest of life with the new good feeling\nI have her do the same thing this time for the future\n\n**JB**: *Well minds blown up now lol is it weird I'm no longer feeling satisfied to just have the things I previous wanted for my future? Like before I set my aims simply and achievable. Now my mind goes wild thinking past the limitations? Or am I just seeing what I wanted but better than I ever wanted? Is that good for me? It feels strange to think that way.*\n\n\n### Intervention #9 - Intensifying pleasure and good emotions in the present\n\n**AG**: *in your wildest dreams you expected to* - Samentically packed word \"wildest\"\n*feel so good* - embedded command in the question\n*about so many things?* - open ended invitation for her unconscious to notice all the things she feels good about\n\nMost people never get close to their dreams, and I'm pointing her to the fact she just went way beyond her wildest ones, while still inducing trance AND building want and anticipation for the future.\n\n**JB**: *No. I didn't in my wildest dreams ever think I could feel so good about everything*\n\n**AG**: *and yet here you are doing it* - Again pointing her breakthrough\n*and more!* - Implying there's more but not stating it, inducing trance by having her go inside and search more \"good stuff\"\n*by trying new things* - In all my clients I install this opeartional belief that trying new things is GOOD\n\n**AG**: *where in your physical body do you feel the best now the most vibrant with life and health? which part of your body feels the most young and fresh?*\n\nSince she still had physical pain, from this point of the session I'm starting to plant seeds of health and leverage good feelings to propel her towards a healthy life, while at the same time pointing towards youth, which is BEFORE she was diagnosed, i.e. she is perfectly healthy.\n\n**JB**: *it's kinda right in my core. In my tummy I guess.* - This is gold my friend! \"core\" is much deeper and powerful than any body part, a wonderful metaphor I'm now going to utilize many times.\n\n**AG**: *in your core ... and what do you feel most in your core and fresh? vibrant? alive? health?*\n\n**JB**: *Buzzing* - Now we have a metaphor of good feelings ABOUT the metaphor of location, depth and level of the body, and I'm going to utilize that as well from this point onwards.\n\n**AG**: *Buzzing ... how interesting isn't it ? and can buzzing spread when it's buzzing in core or it flows first to the rest of you*\n\n**AG**: \"and can buzzing spread when it's buzzing in core or it flows first to the rest of u\" - Inducing further trance and eliciting stronger buzzing\n\n**JB**: *Yes its like spread through me, and like it could spread from me. It's still there even though I'm now sat having a cuppa being less focussed*\n\nRemember the frame of my sessions, everything a client says is GOOD and CAN be utilized, so don't be alarmed by \"less focused\":\n\n**AG**: *and it's still there ... and how strong is someone ... who even when not focused...  has buzzing health in core ... spreading through and from ... on autopilot*\n\nLemme point again how much it's KEY to be in trance when doing this kind of work. This sentence flew right out of my fingers without conscious thinking, and I would NOT have come up with it otherwise. The more you surrender to the process, the more powerful your sessions.\n\n**JB**: *I'd never have guessed that could be me*\n\nThis is an indication about her PAST limitation. It's easy to fall into the logic trap here and start to tear apart the \"deep meaning\" of what this might mean, but instead I let her unconscious and feeling lead her, it's MUCH quicker and powerful than logically talkign about it:\n\n**AG**: *and how does it feel now* - Since I know she's bathed in good chemicals and emotions, I'm leading with feelings  \n*to feel it is you* - Embedded command + pointing her she's breached her past limitations (her past sentence)  \n*and inside of your core* - Utilizing her own metaphor for the level of change  \n*and it could spread from you...* - Again leading with feelings\n\n**JB**: *Is it normal for it to make you feel sort of aroused? That kinda of felt like an weird orgasm there for a while.* - Major progress! It's physically and neurologically impossible to feel anything else than pleasure when having an orgasm, and remember this all stemed out of her past problems. I encourage that for future utilization.\n\n**AG**: *haha yes it's normal that's your brain pleasure receptors opening up*\n\n\n\n### Intervention #10 - Reframing past \"bad\" behaviors\n\n**JB**: *Oh I see, I'm not strange then*\n\n**AG**: *lol ... I am strange lol ... I find normal people boring as fuck (shit, did I say that out loud?? don't tell the others!)* - This is such a common issue, it's always good to make it laughable as well, especially since society and most therapists make it a \"serious\" topic.\n\n**AG**: *in fact*  \n*u would be surprised*  \n*WHY many people come to me*  \n*it's exactly BECAUSE they KNOW at their CORE there's more to experience*  \n*something inside them DO NOT ACCEPT living like most people do*  \n*but until you now learn HOW to*  \n*it seems like you are \"strange\", \"depressed\", \"sick\", and all the other fancy terms society likes to label*\n\n**JB**: *Yeah I get what your saying*  \n\nAnd just like that, all her past bad emotions and pains are unconsciously understood for what they are, her body and mind signaling her something is wrong, and that something in HER is wrong.\n\nIt matters less how \"true\" that is, because it's a BELIEF, and useful beliefs are operationals, and think about the implications of what I just installed in her.\n\nAny physical pain, and emotional pain, is an opportunity for her to improve her life, because the pain is WRONG, the pain is STRANGE, not her. I install this belief in most my clients (and myself) on a regular basis.\n\nIt also ripples out to another belief/generalization to be propelled forwards to \"what will be better\" instead of dwelling on what is/was wrong. It's a powerful unconscious future pacing.\n\n\n### Intervention #11 - Intensifying good feelings and health age regression\nTaking all the good feeligns and age regressing her to a time in which she does not have any pain, and no symptoms of the \"fibro\" or \"CFS\".\n\nThis induction has many layers going on at the same time, I might do a dedicated post for it.\n\n### Intervention #12 - Future pacing getting healthier through time\n**AG**: *the more you go through to the future the healthier you get*\n\n**JB**: *Back 🙂 ahhh so good. I was running! I haven't run in about twenty years, never even liked it but the freedom of running in a light healthy body. Just wonderful. You are awesome you know! I feel healthier already.*\n\nThis is mind blowing for many to comprehend ... she is actually FEELING herself running\n\n**JB**: *Just a powerful and light leisurely run, never done that in life or wanted to so no idea where that came from. My hair grew back. My body slimmed out and my muscles strengthened. I ended up on a beach at sunset. I didn't feel tired from the running. Also had the whole body orgasm thing again. So strange to feel like that with no physical stimulus.*\n\n\n\n### Intervention #13 - connecting good emotions with \"boring\" mundane routine\nShe mentioned she had to do boring things (i.e. work and chores) so I thought \"what the hell, let's make it fun for her\"\nI elicited an \"in the zone\" state, added all the good feelings we've been building, and had her go through the \"boring\" stuff she had to do in her mind.\n\n\n### Intervention #14 - Building want and anticipation for her future and future sessions\n\n**AG**: *and with that, I bid you fare well for today*  \n*I'm very anxious to hear from you again and all the things you are yet to experince!* - Remember she percieved herself as anxious before, so I'm sneaking it in here as a positive thing, anxious towards how good things can get  \n*one last thing, you might have CRAZY FREAKIN dreams and might actually come inside in your sleep or as you wake up so if that happens, yes, it's totally natural*\n\n---\n\n### Three days later ...\n\n---\n\n### Intervention #15 - Turning parents' loss into health resource + future pacing\nJulliane is really something else, she actually started doing this with her mother in her dreams.\n\nI had her use the [grief to appreciation](/tools/grief-to-appreciation/) [tool](/tools/) to further feel her mother's presence, future pace it, and same with her father.\n\n### Intervention #16 - Enjoying social situations\nSince she was demonstrating such an ability to learn quickly, I wanted her to experience a deep trance phenomena, [time distortion](/tools/recurring-time-distortion/), to open up her brain and senses even more.\n\nShe went through the [time distortion](/tools/recurring-time-distortion/) [tool](/tools/) and chose social situations the first time, and intensyfing ecstasy the second time.\n\n**JB**:  *it was going into social situations. I have this thing like going into a party or gathering of people where I'm self conscious and stressed and wired and feeling like I don't want to be there I want to just hide (and often go to the bathroom for space). It was all quite funny really, and the previous feelings got totally distorted. On thinking of it it normal time I no longer felt stressed like I wanted to go to hide in the bathroom. So that's really good!*\n\nShe then had a spontaneous profound realization about WHY she felt so self conscious and dreaded social situations in the past.\n\n**JB**: *I've just worked out why ...*  \n*Why I feel self conscious and worried about how people see me and what they think of me ...*\n\n**AG**: *was this like a realization you just had?*\n\n**JB**: *Yes ... I told you I was raped. It was after a party. I reported it to the police. My friends were asked to provide statements. The statements were read back to me. I didn't realise how much I was observed and judged. Most were lovely. Others said I was flirty, huggy, too trusting... Anyways. Every since that moment, I've felt like everyone is watching me and judging me in a social situation. I guess it's why a party came up as a what I first thought about.*  \n*So I guess I have to do this again for the party lol*  \n\n^^^ Notice she PROACTIVELY takes control of this charged moment. She is not asking me what to do, she goes right at it and does the trauma relief without even asking me. That's a VERY GOOD sign. The more you can get people to ACT, the more independent they will be, the more they will be geared towards SOLVING problems and IMPROVING their life, instead of staying in their old rot.\n\n**JB**: *I made everyone* - Notice again PROACTIVE language  \n*look really silly moving backwards ...* - Silly is the key word, getting people to laugh about their \"problems\"*  \n*Feels like it's over. It's not going to happen like that again.* - That's a much better reaction than \"it will never happen again\", because it might happen again, but now she knows it will not be like that, not affect her the same way as before  \n*Excited to see how I feel at the next social thing I have to do* - More GOLD. She's excited towards what used to make her DREAD just a few moments ago ...  \n*It means I can enjoy socialising more. Means I have made more progress to being happy and healthy again.* - Most important part, she's headed towards more happiness and health, it's just a question of how quickly she will get there now\n\n### Intervention #17 - Enjoying social situations - future pacing\nI have her connect all the great feelings AND health and hook it into future social situations\n\n**JB**: *Everything is getting so vivid now when I'm imagining stuff*  \n*It's like someone has switched my brain into. HD*\n\n### Intervention #18 - Prepping for doctors appointment\nI wanted to make sure she will take anything the doctor says in prespective of the doctor's limited knowledge and understanding. Most doctors mean well, but they often times hurt their clients unintentionaly since they are not trained in language and brain processes.  \nI told her about many past mistakes doctors and scientists made about what possible or not for humans to do. She connected with it right away.\n\nThis is when she sent me the list of symptoms, and the progress since she started learning with me 3 days ago (see above)\n\n### Intervention #19 - Compounding good feelings\n\nI had her cycle thru good feelings from different experiences, compounding excitement, focus and energy, adding sparkels, and then while going to the future, feel herself running and jump into someone else's POV.\n\nSo she will go for a run in her mind, and see more people around running faster than her, and then jump to one of the faster runners' POV.\n\nThis is a sneaky way to expand her health feelings and push her limits, since it's easier to visualize someone else running faster than you, and by jumping to his POV, you get to feel the good feelings of running that fast.\n\nShe seemed to like it ... ;)\n\n**JB**: *It was amazing 😛*  \n*earth moved haha*  \n*I had a busy day ahead though so I didn't spend as long as I'd have liked being totally immersed in it*  \n*and had to peel myself up and get on. I think I'll make a date with myself tomorrow morning to revisit that 🙂*  \n\n---\n\n### Few days later ...\n\n---\n\n### Intervention #20 - Installing pre sleep routine\n\n**AG**: *when you get into your bed cycle through past events the ones*  \n*in which you feel the most vibrant alive bathed in health*  \n*and do the thing you bath yourself in the good healthy feelings, and then jump to the next one*  \n*... as you do so think about the good sleep your about to have and see yourself waking up in the morning 10x times more vibrant and healthy 10x times the energy*  \n*... this will condition your brain and your body to cycle this FOR you on autopilot while you sleep and dream*  \n*... just remember not to jump to hard from the bed you are still not 120% yet!*  \n*... imagine all the good feelings you could be having during the night!*  \n*... we want to squeeze every moment of your being towards buzzing vibrant colorful feelings*  \n\n---\n\n# Verbatim Transcript\n\n",

Quite a bit around that time\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">gotcha\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">now since I can't read minds, and I'm not there with you, the only I can know what's going on is what you feed me\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">does this make sense?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Yeah it does.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">wonderful\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">now\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">Here's how iit's going to work\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">This is not therapy, I'm not a therapist, nor do I ever wish to be.\nwhen I was still down in the past, insomniac, in pain and depressed,\nI did not find any of them to be useful,\nand I've talked to hundreds of \"professionals\" ...\n\nwhat we are about to do is all 100% open and natural for you to learn and experience,\nand here's how it's going to work,\nas I've been studying human behavior, organisms,\n\nhow society shapes behavior, communication,\nand the greatest learning machine of all,\nthe human brain,\n\nI'm going to give you some things to try, and\n\nwhatever works for you you get to keep,\nwhatever doesn't you file away in the\n\n\"thing's I've tried and haven't worked for me yet.\"\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">sounds good?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Yup!\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Great!\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">so let's start with something simple\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">Think about one memory that still bothers u\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">and you will feel better now that you are about to learn to feel better about it\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">something that happened\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">could be physical voilence, and argument, whatever it is\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">think of one specific thing that happened\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">got it?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">OK well I'll start with the lier thing. That hurt more than the trauma in some ways. Craving support and help when people turned their backs and supported the person who attacked me.\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">Remember sitting by a lake feeling desperate. Writing poems and trying to make sense of it all\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">I feel so bad for that girl.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">okay\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">that's good you have this separation\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">it means the hard part u've already done on your own, without even realizing\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">now\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">let's first only focus on the attack itself okay?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Ok\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">ok now\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">when I had an accident with my brother\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">a few seconds before the car hit us\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">we were just on the motorcycle and everything was okay\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">no signs of danger\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">then the accident happened\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">there was some high emotions there\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">and a few moments after we pulled over, exchanged details with the other driver, and everything was okay again\ndanger is gone\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">even tho my leg was still hurting\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">the danger of the moment itself is gone\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">makes sense\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Yeah it does\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">okay\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">so for u\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">how old were you in that past memory&gt;?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">I was 15. At a party. Like you say felt no danger, was having fun. The older boy said he would walk me home. I trusted him.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">okay\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">15\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">so\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">I want you to go over the following steps, about that memory, and then describe to me the process u've done\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\"><a href=\"/tools/trauma-relief/\">http://www.adamgoldman.me/tools/trauma-relief/</a>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Ok\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">I'm done\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">Blimy, that's very interesting! The colour you got was very significant\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">I got\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">okay\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">now\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">describe to me, step by step, in your own words, what did you do\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">I watched myself at the party. Certain moments flashed back. Watched her leave with the older boy, watched her walk. Saw his intent from the start which I have never seen before. Watched how it happened. Remembered the grass and how it felt on my back. It's what I focused on at the time I think because I gave up struggling and waited for it to be over. Then I was Sat in my bed room in the floor crying after I got home. That's when I reminded. We had this program here in the UK many years ago called the benny Hill show. The music and the shows so comical and quick moving. That's how I played it back. It was really strange watching such a traumatic experience to such a fun and humourous beat. And then when I focused on how I felt after I felt good from in my chest. And It felt green like fresh morning grass. Bright as a green go sign. Positive and new. Which feels good. But very strange.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">It does feel strange, doesn't it?\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">so now\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">as you think about that same memory again\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">how do you feel?\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">what's different?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Yes very strange. I feel good. Its like it wasn't what it was?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">do you want me to revert you back to your old feelings?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">No way lol I like this.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">ha!\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">isn't it interesting\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">I wonder\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">if you already begin to wonder\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Yes it's actually pretty incredible.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">how curious you become now\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">as you think of this moment\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">not too far from now\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">where you already learned how to turn more and more things\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">that used to bother u\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">to this new\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">pretty incredible feeling\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">comical even\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">how awesome is that?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">It is very awesome. And I didn't think it would be possible.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">did you know you are going to feel so good about this just a few moments ago before we started?\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">and you didn't think it would be possible ...\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">I wonder what else you can begin to wonder,\nas you wander around these good feelings,\nabout what it is that is possible for you now,\nthat you know what you know\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">And I've tried so many times to play it back, make sense of it. See whether I did make it happen if it was my fault. If I remember it right. To suddenly feel this way is incredible.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">describe to me this incredible feeling\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">And yes. The possibilities now seem quite wonderous\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">I think i've earned to have some of that too!\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">the more you share the better you feel you know <img alt=\"😉\" class=\"_1ift _2560 img\" src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z57/1/16/1f609.png\"></div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Lol yes.

I remember lots of good experiences with my friend like laughter and togetherness and acceptance, support and encouragement. Where as I struggle to think of those times with my mother as they are clouded by the sense of loss that I feel. And also by the fact that when I was grown up enough to have more of a friendship with my mother - my mother was diagnosed with dementia and I lost that stage of our relationship. Back to the exercise though, the good feelings were like smoke that I breathed in. And they traveled around my body in my blood stream just like oxygen would. It wasn't powerful but it was significant and relaxing and tranquil. Whooshing round my body. And in my head I could picture my mother next to my friend in all the lovely memories I have with my friend. It was nice.

To hold it back then stretching and closing my eyes preparing to run. Focusing back on the exercise. Seeing the people with me. Seeing them in the positive situations with me. Then breathing in the smoke, and feeling it stronger and stronger. Then startting to run. Watching my life playing out in a haze either side of me smiling at what's happening. All the good things I wanted to see pausing each taking deep breaths of the positive smoke and breathing it back out towards all the events I'm seeing and watching it infuse the future images positively.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">wow\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">that's amazing\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">It feels amazing.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">how intensely does this compels you to run towards health and a brighter future\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Very much.

This time is was for energy. And the memory was dancing. Dancing was a massive part of my childhood. I trained to be a dancer, did very well and performed on some big stages. Till I got unwell that is <img alt=\"😕\" class=\"_1ift _2560 img\" src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zf2/1/16/1f615.png\"> had to give it up. Anyways I'm telling you cause this time I wasn't just running. I was dancing. Running and leaping through the past and stopping to dance at the various points I reached I wanted to experience and fill with smoke. And this time when I had finished my trip through the future. I danced on the beach. With my parents and my friend. And there were others, faces I've never seen that wanted to dance with me. Faces I had forgotten in the past. And I finished by stepping back from them as they carried in dancing into the night. I laid on the sand and carried on experiencing the feelings and the smoke and the intense pleasure. And I suppose now more expectedly had the whole body climax again.

I didn't realise how much I was observed and judged. Most were lovely. Others said I was flirty, huggy, too trusting... Anyways. Every since that moment, I've felt like everyone is watching me and judging me in a social situation. I guess it's why a party came up as a what I first thought about.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\"><div class=\"chat-message-image\" role=\"presentation\" data-testid=\"0\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://scontent.fskg1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-0/p480x480/21057915_10154931809393379_1502132383_o.png?oh=f6f01b4f96a6808e7e0b1d937204c326&amp;oe=59AA67E9&quot;);\"><img class=\"_52mr _5pf5 img\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://scontent.fskg1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-0/p480x480/21057915_10154931809393379_1502132383_o.png?oh=f6f01b4f96a6808e7e0b1d937204c326&amp;oe=59AA67E9\" style=\"max-width: 100%; width: 100%;\"><a aria-label=\"Open Photo\" class=\"_4tsl\" href=\"https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.fskg1-1.fna.fbcdn.net%2Fv%2Ft35.0-0%2Fp480x480%2F21057915_10154931809393379_1502132383_o.png%3Foh%3Df6f01b4f96a6808e7e0b1d937204c326%26oe%3D59AA67E9&amp;h=ATPE7WAbDG2P10tETa3MEc6GsI5GGGHXxowBetuNme-Eci9jish8I71Tpnn8gW8utw7oCzphCbvxK_1-TRYiVCFV7KG0KKIWphT-o1Ctok65PsZJXThAhZ_m8Lll3UYJlZqqyA\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></div></div><div class=\"chat-message\">So I guess I have to do this again for the party lol\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">well\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">what happens now as you think of that party?\n</div><div class=\"chat-message\">and what happened?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">I made everyone look really silly moving backwards it's helped.\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix adam\"><div class=\"chat-message\">u don't say <img alt=\"😉\" class=\"_1ift _2560 img\" src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z57/1/16/1f609.png\"></div><div class=\"chat-message\">what happens now as you think of it?\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"><div class=\"chat-message\">Feels like it 's over.

Some of the \"dry\" details were slightly altered to preserve her privacy.\n\nI want you to notice the general background feeling of the interaction, as you go through this. The \"11\" interventions are powerful on their own, but it's not as powerful as me doing this entire session as one long induction, in which I clearly set the frame of me having control and that as long as she continues to do what I say, her problems WILL be over, and there's just no two ways to go about it.\n\nI will write a dedicated post for frame control later on, but for now just notice the ongoing \"tone\" I'm setting here.\n\nThis is something I'm harping on with many of my students and colleagues. The client needs to KNOW and feel ONE HUNDRED PERCENT that there's just no way I'm going to let her stay the same way. It's just not an option.\n\nLet's begin ...\n\nRight out of the gate, she pretty much gave it away:\n\n**J**: \"OCD is *your head telling you* to carry out rituals and do things perfectly or something bad will happen ... If I don't do these things *my head tells me* something bad will happen\"\n\nShe has an internal dialog telling her \"do this or else ...\"\nAt a later point she also mentioned the voice is followed by visualizations of loved ones dying.\n\n### Intervention #1 - Slowing down internal dialog\nSo the first things I've done with her is changing the way she talked to herself. I had her choose one of the more \"nasty\" sentences she had going on, and running it through the [internal dialog scrambeler](/tools/internal-dialog-scrambler/), a [tool](/tools/) to slow the tempo of the voice methodically.\n\nShe reported immediate relief:\n\"I feel much less stressed and almost see the funny side ... I am very chilled out and not panicking\"\n\nThen we generalized the learning and ran the same process on more nasty sentences she was saying to herself, until it became automatic, and she could literally not talk to herself that way anymore.\nI do this with almost every client, and I've found it to be immensly useful and powerful. This is the turning point of hope and belief. When a client literally cannot engage in the old behavior, and cannot make herself feel bad, it's like a positive \"point of no return.\"\n\nAt this point all the internal dialog that used to terrify Jennifer was now laughable and actually inducing calmness.\n\n### Intervention #2 - Building want and anticipation for the future\n\nI leveraged that state to build want and anticipation towards a brighter future after the \"condition\" will be \"cured\", using clean language and hypnotic patterns.\n**AG**: *\"did you expect to feel so calm before we started?*\n... and to be able to laugh at those sentences?\n... you did not expect to feel as good so fast, did you?\n... take a moment to think about all the things you will do when life is much easier\"\n\nThis is also something I do with amost everyone I work with. It's a sneaky little trick to engage the client in unconscious positive processes, because I KNOW Jennifer did NOT expect to feel this way, and I want her to start wondering what else she can feel great about without expecting it.\nIt's a very useful state to have your client in, especially since I've found almost 100% of clients (and people) I encounter tend to look for what's wrong and what COULD go wrong in their lives, and be in constant state of dread.\n\nThis is a simple and quick way to start switching a person's grid in which she sees life through. There's only so much we can percieve in any given moment, and the more I can tune her RAS (reticular activating system) towards good feelings and experiences, the more she will notice (and create) them, and the less place she will have left for negative stuff.\n\n### Intervention #3 - Recoding future visualizations of loved ones dying\nBefore we've done the [internal dialog scrambeler](/tools/internal-dialog-scrambler/) on the \"do this or else\" voices, she mentioned she has visualizations of loved ones dying following the voices. Her internal method to generate the compulsive behavior was:\nInternal Dialog - \"do this or else\" -> Visualizations of loved ones dying\n\nEven tho the first part of the strategy, the internal dialog, was broken/cured, I did not want to leave her nasty visualizations \"floating around\" her psyche.\n\nIt's not needed \"per se\", but it's fast and easy to do, AND it will teach her more about running her own brain, so it strikes me as a good return for our time together.\n\nI had her run the [trauma relief process](/tools/trauma-relief/) on one of these visualizations, and during that a past trauma has popped up ...\n\n**J**: *I'm getting mixed up with an event in the past that did happen and my visualisation*\n\n### Intervention #4 - Clearing the trauma of the accident\nI had her use the [trauma relief tool](/tools/trauma-relief/) on that \"event in the past\", and she said:\n\n**J**: *It's probably the first time I've not cried thinking about the past event ... It's still upsetting having it okay in my mind but I'm calmer*\n\nSince there were still negative emotions (\"still upsetting\") I've proceeded to walk he through the process, step by step.\n\nThis is when I learned about the accident of her sister (the past event she was referring to).\n\nI've found that when working with traumas and bad experiences, one of the key points for healing is identifying a \"before\" and \"after\" moments, in which the person is perfectly safe. \n\nJennifer picked an \"after\" moment which is after the accident itself, but still dealing with it:\n\n**J**: *I felt sorry for her she was a mess and covered in blood blaming herself*\n\nThis happens from time to time, as most traumas will have two parts: The event itself, and the \"dealing\" with the event afterwards and thinking about the consequences.\n\nIn our story here, the plot thickens, as the accident was followed by 2 years of her sister being hospitalized, so there's no clear \"after\" moment in which there's no trace of the event. If that's not enough, her sister suffered brain damage AND got blind following the accident, and that still goes on today, so I had to be creative here.\n\n### Intervention #5 - Inducing positive state and finding a positive hook after the accident\nI had her find of the best moments in time after the accident, in which she feels really good, and it's a pure positive moment. Then had her intensify the good feelings of that moment with the [feel good generator tool](/tools/feel-good-generator/).\n\nThe point here was:\n1. Get her out of the negative state she was in\n2. Find a strong positive feeling to \"hook\" the end of the accident to. This moment will serve as the \"after\" moment for the trauma relief process we'll do on the accident memory.\n\nIn that memory she is 26, holding the hand of her new born baby sister, feeling \"Proud and full of love, Excited\". That's 2 years after the accident.\n\n**J**: *My tears have stopped I feel happy and relieved*\n\nSo point 1 from the above was achieved. I had her intensify the good feelings even more and then repeat the process from her baby sister's POV. The reasons for doing this deserve a dedicated post of their own, so briefly the benefits from doing this is:\n\n1. Intensifying good feelings even more, but from a different angle (and a different area in the brain).\n2. Experience her own love towards her baby sister from the recieving end.\n3. Experience herself through the eyes of someone who loves her AND feel protected by her.\n4. Since this is done under the context of the accident, we are connecting more and more positive emotions to the accident.\n\n<br />\n\n### Intervention #6 - breaking the compulsive rituals (mentally)\nSince I got her high on good feelings I felt this is a good chance to see how she feels about the compulsive thoughts and behaviors WHILE feeling so good.\n\nMany people make the mistake of NOT thinking about their problems when they feel good.\n\nI found many times the simple process of making a good feeling and then thinking of a problem is enough to dissolve it completely.\n\n**AG**: *let's do a little test, what were some of your old triggers?*\n\n**J**: *Things not being equal 🙈 fear of number 3, things not in order or not closed properly*\n\nNotice the monkey overing eyes emoticon here. She can't believe that was actually her once!\n\nTime to move in for the kill ...\n\n**AG**: *does that sound silly to you now?*  \n**J**: *Extremely*  \n**AG**: *laughable?*  \n**J**: *Yes embarrassing*  \n**AG**: *lol I want you to see yourself doing some of your old behaviors ...*  \n*and notice how silly was it ...*  \n*to live that way ...*  \n*and notice ...*  \n*which kind of laugh does that induces within you the most ...*  \n*describe that laugh to me 🙂*\n\n**This is an extremely high packed moment in the session, let me break down what's going on here ...**\n\n1. *let's do a little test*  \nPresupposing this is nothing big, we are going to test something trivial <br /><br />\n  \n2. *what were some of your old triggers?*  \nPresupposing it's all in the past now:  \nWhat WERE some of your OLD triggers, and not what ARE some of your triggers. <br /><br />  \n\n3. *does that sound silly to you now? ... laughable?*  \nAttaching silly feelings in the present to her old past triggers <br /><br />\n\n4. *I want you to see yourself doing some of your old behaviors*  \n\"see yourself\" - Dissasociating  \n\"old\" - stacking past presupposition  \n\"behaviors\" - before we applied silliness to the triggers, now we are addressing her behaviors directly <br /><br />\n\n5. *notice how silly was it ... to live that way*  \n\"silly\" - attaching silliness to her past behaviors themselves  \n\"was\" - stacking more past presuppositions <br /><br />\n\n6. *notice ... which kind of laugh does that induces within you the most ...*  \nThis is an intersting comparison I have her do here. I'm asking her to go through all the kinds of laughter she knows, and try out her old compulsion triggers with each one, and notice which one is the STRONGEST.\n<br />\nIt's an elegant way to get her lost in different types of good feelings (different types of laugher), and unconsciously link them to be induced by what USED TO BE her problems and unwanted behaviors.\n<br />\n<br />\nThis is one of the benefits of going into deep altered states (deep trance) while working with a client.\n<br />\n<br />\nGoing over this now, I literally find it hard to believe that was me producing that sentence.\n<br />\n<br />\nThere's so much packed into that moment, it's way more than a conscious mind can process in a split second. I did not thought in my head \"hmmm let's make her compare between different types of laughters\".\n<br />\n<br />\nThis is me surrendering to the \"flow\" of the interaction, and I highly suggest you do the same with your own clients. My best moments (almost) always come from being in this state, when working with clients and otherwise. <br /><br />\n\n7. *describe that laugh to me*  \nIntensifying the strongest laughter feeling from the comparison in point 6.\n<br />\n<br />\n\nI then proceeded to intensify the laughter feeling, add sparkles and a color to it (induce synesthesia), and have her go through all her past compulsive behaviors and increase the silly feeling with each one, and increasing the synesthesia by adding a smell to the feeling.\n\n### Intervention #7 - breaking the compulsive rituals (physically in real life)\nWhile spinning the good feelings, I had her break all her old compulsive behaviors one by one, and making a joke out of each one in between.\n\n### Intervention #8 - Future pacing a life without the problems\nI had her spin and integrate the silliness feeling while going forward through time, imagining her next 20-30 years laughing at her old limitations.\n\n### Intervention #9 - Video of herself breaking old behaviors\nThis is not something that's \"required\" per se, but it's a good amplifier. I want her to have a tangible \"trophy\" for this experience, and a physical proof of how silly her old behaviors, which she percieved as collusal problems, really are. \n\nOur minds can be tricky devils, and any past experience can be distorted to fit a narrative, so having a recorded video will make sure this will be available for her to watch, enjoy, and remember, for years to come.\n\nAlso, I want her to have an extremely powerful resource as an anchor that past limitations do not need to affect her anymore in a way that is not useful, and that any situation can be turned around to a positive one.\n\n### Intervention #10 - Clearing the guilt from the accident\nWe did another [trauma relief process](/tools/trauma-relief/) on the accident, with two main alterations:\n1. Just before starting, have her watch the \"trophy\" video she just made of breaking old habits  <br /><br />\n2. Have her end the process this time in the point in which she learns about her mother pregnancy, and the baby sister she is about to have.\nThis is mainly for hooking the end of that memory to hope and anticipation (for her soon to be born baby sister)\n<br />\nAll her guilt was gone:\n\n**J**: *It feels clearer and I don't feel guilt*\n\n### Intervention #11 - Establishing sister as cue for good feelings\nI then had her intensify the good feelings from clearing the trauma and everything else we've done, induced synsteshia, and elicited a metaphor for the good feelings, which she described as a white clear liquid.\n\nThen had her think about the next time she sees her sister that had the accident, and enjoying that liquid with her. I want her sister to now be a cue for GOOD feelings, instead of the old feelings of guilt, shame, and compulsive thoughts.\n\n---\n\n# Verbatim Transcript\n",

I sometimes fight the urge and tell myself it's nonsense, how can i be responsible for something bad happening because I done something 3 times and not 4?? \n\n  I also have to 'touch wood' several times a day when negative or bad thoughts enter my head (in doing it now because I've just typed that).\n\n  I have to have all my tins facing forwards in the cupboard and they have to be lined up, my food in the fridge goes in a certain way too. Again, if I don't do this something bad will happen.\n\n  Hope this helps you understand a little. I can't even understand it myself it's crazy, extremely frustrating and embarrassing.\n  </div></div><div class=\"chat-message-container clearfix other\"></div><div class=\"chat-message-container

How can I say this ...\n\nI'm getting this so often that I've actually took the time to dedicate a whole page so you can understand just how \"unique\" and \"different\" you are.\n\nHere's the thing ...\n\nWe all want to think we are a special snowflake, and that there's just something about us that's just different, and there is!\n\nYour life experiences are yours and yours alone.\n\nNo one else on this planet has the exact same experiences, genes, DNA or body like you.\n\nSo go look in the mirror, smile at that sexy figure starring lustly at you, and say to yourself \"This is me, and there could be only one!\"\n\nSay it loud, say it proud, and let's move on, okay?\n\nThe STRUCTURE in which you make your problems is all that matters, and it all goes thru your senses, so you are mainly:\n\n- Talking to yourself (what most people call \"thinking\")\n - \"It's like I have this voice in my head telling me to ...\"\n - \"There's this voice telling me I'm not enough\"\n- Seeing pictures\n - \"I can see them laughing at me!\"\n- Hearing sounds\n - \"I just hear his voice and I flip!\"\n - \"Loud eating / chewing make me go crazy\"\n- Feeling body sensations\n - \"I can still feel my back against the grass / concrete\" (not uncommon for rape victims)\n - \"It sends shivers down my spine\"\n\nStop right now and think about your biggest problem. One that seem to almost control you and your life. One that once we'll solve, your life will be infintely better.\n\nGot it?\n\nNow notice what's the first thing that comes to your mind AS you are thinking about this problem.\n\nMost OCD cases I've encountered make themselves compulsive by first hearing an internal dialog that goes something like:\n\n\"You MUST wash your hands 5 times or else ... \"\n\nAnd then visualizing a loved one getting killed or some other lovely scenario.\n\nSo in order to break this pattern, all they have to do is skew the internal dialog, scramble the nasty visualization, and lo and behold, \"OCD\" gone.\n\nIf it sounds simple it's only because IT IS, and the more you can let go of your \"higher intelect\" and just start to be willing to experiment, the faster you will get it too.\n\nSo back to you ...\n\nHOW are you making this big problem of yours?\n\nIt's a weird question, but just go with me for a moment or two ok?\n\nWhat do you SEE in your mind? Do you see yourself in that picture, or is it through your own eyes?\n\nWhat do you HEAR in your mind? Is it your voice? Do you hear it from your left? your right? infront? inside?\n\nNow notice where in your body you feel what is it that you feel. Is it more in your chest? your legs? Your back?\n\nI'm gonna guess it's NOT in your knees, and also NOT in your knuckles of your fingers, but you can swear this is a problem and that you feel bad about it right?\nIf you still can't find WHERE is the feeling, keep eliminating places it's definitely NOT in, until you zoom in your suspect.\n\nAnd that's the level in which we'll do most of the learning and work.\n\nThis is NOT therapy.\nI ain't gonna bore you to death about what your behaviors \"mean\" and \"why\" you are so screwed up.\n\nWhat we do works, and it works FAST.\n\nSo when you are ready to join the others and learn to operate your brain better, talk to me and let's do this.\n\n",

I will take things and then people will find out and THEY will have to deal with it*\n\nBy THEY, as it turns out, she refers to mom and paps, which apparently suffocate her and rule her life, down to the tiniest of parts.\n\nBeing a good Jewish daughter, she ought to “respect thy father and mother”, so defying them DIRECTLY or standing up for herself was not an option.\n\nAna: *Oh wow … I … But I am a good daughter … I don’t want to steal … I don’t want to say no to my parents … But this is my way to show them ... They deserve it!*\n\nShe poured a few more minutes about this, and proceeded to say she’s never seen it so clearly before.\n\nTo fully resolve this situation I need to see her AND more importantly, her parents, both of which I had no time for, as I was leaving Israel at the time.\n\nHer therapist updates me from time to time, saying she keeps mentioning our time together and asks when do I return.\n\nNo operational results this with Anat, tho was an interesting time indeed.\n",

We mapped it across. Lo and behold the dude loves himself now :)\n\nWe're still in touch to this day, he's actually a very interesting piece of human being, I learn a lot from him and we constantly bounce ideas off each other.\n\nHe was so blown away from his fast change he started learning NLP as well and now helps others on a regular basis.\n\nIf you are in Israel, I highly recommend paying him a visit.

Jot that down\n6. What would success mean to you for this event or thing? **How does the IDEAL scenario looks, sounds, and feels like**?\n7. Jot that down\n8. As you hold that success in your mind, **u might feel some tension**. This is GOOD. There's a discrepancy between now and the future success reality.\n9. Your brain will want to **relieve that tension by *storming*you with ideas**.\n10. Take as long as it needs to **dump ALL of that** into the screen or paper.  \n(Resist the urge to organize or 'check' these ideas. This is what the NEXT step is for. Can I trust you with this?)\n11. NOW begin to **organize these ideas**. What's more important? What is relevant?\nWhat should happen first?\n12. **What's the #1 most important idea** about this project\n13. **What's the** very **next** **ACTIONABLE thing** that needs to happen to move this forward?  \n(Bad example: set meeting; Better example: Call Sarah to set meeting next week)\n14. **Highlight it and write where, with whom or what**you will do this. In your office? Your laptop? Mobile? Next time you meet Sarah? In the store?\n15. Pay attention to the rest of the thoughts that might have popped during this quick experience\n16. Jot 'em down and apply any of the steps only as far as you continue to enjoy it\n\n> ###### *\"OMG! all that time I've been keeping all that in my head?\"*\n<small>The usual response Mr. David and I get when walking clients through this process</small>\n\nLike a breeze of fresh air you get for free without getting any smarter.\n\nAs you look at your quick accomplishment, **notice how better you feel about this \"thing\"** or project and your life.\n\nNot too shabby for a few moments of your time eh?\n(If you don't feel it yet, I'll go out on a limb and say you did not follow the steps, did you? Bad human! BAD!)\n\nU haven't actually \"done\" or \"produced\" anything *per se*, BUT, your mind as one less thing to take care of. \n\n**U will no longer worry *about* the project** or \"thing\".\n\nThere's just one ACTIONABLE thing to do, in a very specific context (hint: step 14).\n\nAs I was doing this with all my past [project](STRIKE) worries, a growing sense of liberation, comfort, focus and control got stronger and stronger the more I thought about each of them for the last time.\n\nSome of my clients experience it differently.  \nClarity, peace, relief, are just some of the things often sneak in as we do this.\n\nAnd the more they apply the [whole methodology](http://amzn.to/2uMAYZa), the stronger they become.\n\nIt's real thing of beauty when it works ;)\n\nThe fastest way to transition yourself to a mind like water state is with [personal guidance](/lets-talk/), and you, like me, might want to [take a swing at it on your own](http://amzn.to/2tKX01m) first.\n\nMost importantly, don't **forget the tartar sauce**!\n",

People who hang around me for a whole day would be SHOCKED how much stuff I put in and \"where does it go damnit???\"\n\nThe idea of NOT stuffing myself for 16 hours was, to say the least, very unappealing.\n\nThe next day I woke up, went to the closest Starbucks in Makati, and had my first coffee at 09:00. If you ever been to starbucks, you know how those devilish bastarts set the stage for your hands to involuntary reach out for some \"healthy goodies\":\n\n(picture of aisle here with arrows and what not)\n\nHunger was high, DESIRE was high, and oddly enough, double O Goldman hands decided to behave and go only for the double long espresso.\n\nAs time went by, halfway through the coffee, I guess I forgot about my devouring craves, and only about 2 hours later, when I took a break and walked around a bit, stomach started demanding attention again.\n\nRight ...\n\"Another double long espresso please!\"\n\nI can swear to god some of those crossoiants and cakes where winking my way, and again, oddly enough, my hands and I were on the same side.\n\nThis time I had a much breasier time the first hour. First sip of coffee took the hunger away, almost magically. But it did NOT last long ...\n\none hour later I got super hungry again, and coffee or tea would not gonna cut it this time. I need something more.\n\nI broke the fast, early than expected.\n\n\"Another double long espresso please! and some soy milk on the side.\"\n\nI was \"supposed\" to consume calories not before 14:00, but screw that, I had to ingest SOMETHING, but here's the thing see ...\n\nI did not FEEL like that puny plunge of soy milk would be enough, but how trustworthy are our feelings anyway? So I experiment instead, which seem to outperform feelings and theory (almost) every time for me.\n\nLo and behold, 10 minutes and an enhanced double long espresso later, no hunger. \nWas a smooth sailing to 14:00.\n\nTo be continued ...\n\n---\n\n## Controversial vegan dead lift champion\nMeet Dr. Amen-ra, 2011 [dead lift champion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpj00GoS3S0) that's been eating veggies and nuts only at nights for 20+ years with his wife, and is just a \"bit\" unconventional fellow ...\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dR1FCJS8DoM?modestbranding=1&rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

Solving 100 addition questions and then 100 multiplication, is not as effective is alternating every 5.\n\n- Teaching others what u've learned greatly solidifies learning.\n\n- Recall information in different physical positions while moving to solidify learning.\n\n- Rehearse in your mind while walking to the bus, being bored, etc\n\n- students who have blindly followed their passion, without rational analysis of whether their choice of career truly was wise, have been more unhappy with their job choices than those who coupled passion with rationality.\n\n- Use metaphors. It’s often helpful to pretend you are the concept you are trying to understand. Put yourself in an electron’s warm and fuzzy slippers as it burrows through a slab of copper, or sneak inside the x of an algebraic equation, or a graph equation\n\n- Remember people’s names by retrieving the people’s names from memory at increasing time intervals after first learning the name\n\n- Memory palace - Mentally walk in a place you know and place things you want to remember along the way, i.e. a giant egg open you the door, gets crushed by a pack of sugar, then in the corridor there's a pack of cigarettes (which you might wanna quit but don't know how to yet?)\n\n- Using sentences to memorize: King Henry Died While Drinking Chocolate Milk. This translates to kilo —1,000; Hecto—100; Deca—10; “while” represents 1; Deci—0.1; Centi—0.01; Milli—0.001\n\n- Acronyms to memorize - Let’s say you wanted to remember four plants that help ward off vampires—garlic, rose, hawthorn, and mustard. The first letters abbreviate to GRHM, so all you need to do is remember the image of a GRAHAM cracker.\n\n- Combine memory palace with sentences: Let’s say you are trying to remember the mineral hardness scale, which ranges from 1 to 10 (talc 1, gypsum 2, calcite 3, fluorite 4, apatite 5, orthoclase 6, quartz 7, topaz 8, corundum 9, diamond 10). You can come up with a memory sentence mnemonic: Terrible Giants Can Find Alligators or Quaint Trolls Conveniently Digestible. The problem is that it can still be difficult to remember the sentence. But things become easier if you then add the memory palace. At your front door, there is a terrible giant there, holding a can. Once inside, you find an alligator\n\n- If you’re memorizing something commonly used, see whether someone’s come up with a particularly memorable memory trick by searching it out online. Otherwise, try coming up with your own (and open source it)!\n\n- Persistence is often more important than intelligence.\n\n- Approaching material with a goal of learning it on your own gives you a unique path to mastery.\n\n- Ask questions to LEARN, not to show how much you know (like most people do)\n\n- A simple sentence growing from the vast experience of a mentor can change the course of your future\n\n- Truly great teachers make the material seem both simple and profound, set up mechanisms for students to learn from each other, and inspire students to learn on their own\n\n- Learning and brainstorming with like minded people is easier, but if your all TOO like minded about too many things, you won't uncover each others' blind spots.\n\n- \"You need to think about what the equation means, so that your math result and your intuition match. If they don’t match, then you have either a mistake in your math or a mistake in your intuition. Either way, you win by figuring out why the two don’t match\"\n\n- Explore the end of the model for better understanding. For a complicated expression, take limiting cases where one variable or another goes to zero or infinity, and see if that helps you understand what the equation is saying\n\n- Testing is itself an extraordinarily powerful learning experience\n\n- outline lots of problem solutions quickly, without spending time on the algebra and calculations, so you practice big picture thinking\n\n- If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself - **Albert Einstein**\n\n## Taking tests\n- Scan entire test, start with hardest question, pull away to an easy question the moment you get stuck. This will get your difuse mode thinking working on the hard task in the background, as you work yoru way through the easy questions. I've never thought about that personally, it sounds like a nifty little tricks indeed! This can be applied to any task, at the office or in our personal lives.\n- Panic and anxiety - Move THROUGH the sensations instead of fighting them, and turn your attention inwards, to your breathing and your body. Acknowledge what's going on PHYSICALLY, i.e. \"my palms are sweaty, my heart is beating a bit faster\". That's better than \"OMG what's happening to my body\", which is generating a fear OF the fear, and then your screwed ;)\n- Study in the same place or at least a similar enviornment as the place you will take the test.\n- Bonus: [Talk to me](/lets-talk/), I have some mind tricks up my sleeve :)\n- Doube check your answers in random order, not sequentially front to back, so you \"catch you brain\" ungaurd and process the information differently.\n- Write any negative thought immediately before the test.\n\n## Procrastination Zombies\n- The dread of doing a task often consumes more time and energy than the task itself\n- Zombies cannot be vanquished by will power\n- Habit cycle: Cue -> Routine -> Reward -> Belief\n- ways of breaking the habit:\n  1. Develop different cues (learn for the exam in a different place, different time, with different people)\n  2. Set time limit (study for 10 minutes, instead of until you finish problems a be see., this was you can't fail see :)\n  3. contrast mental images. Make one vivid image of what will happen if you do the task (get a better job, promotion, etc), and one iamge if you don't (get fired, begging for money)\n  4. Pomodoro technique and protecting yourself from peeps in an elegant \n\n## Tricks for anti procrastination:\n 1. Wear sport cloth, prime yourself for workout\n 2. Get up easily by mentally crave your breakfast, instead of \"having\" to get up\n 3. Identify the easiest part to start with\n 4. ^^^ Organise material needed (for math problem, copy needed equations etc ...)\n 5. silence phone and laptop notifications\n 6. log activities for a few weeks and notice your procrastination triggers\n 7. write tomorrow's to do list prior bed time.\n 8. Do the most important and most disliked jobs first, as soon as you wake up, when you are highest in energy (could be after a coffee or two ;)\n 9. Infuse physical tasks (laundry, weeding, dishes) between mental ones\n 10. Break long period goals to daily processes\n 11. Put visual reminders of your end goal (look at the salary of an engineer while learning for the exam)\n 12. Paralyzed? Jot down 3 micro-tasks you can do in minutes\n 13. reward small chunks of progress (i.e. 5 minutes of YouTube after 1 pomodoro)\n\n## Resources\n- The [Pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) technique (varied prices and resources):\nTasks, Planning, and Flash Cards\n- [30/30](http://3030.binaryhammer.com/) — combines timers with a task list\n- [StudyBlue](http://www.studyblue.com/) — combines flash cards and notes with text messages when it’s time to study again, along with a direct link to the material\n- [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) — One of author's personal favorites; very popular for noting task lists and random pieces of information (replaces the little notebook writers have long carried to keep track of their ideas)\n- [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) — one of the best pure flash card systems, with an excellent spaced repetition algorithm; many excellent premade decks are available for a variety of disciplines\n- [Quizlet.com](http://quizlet.com/) — allows you to input your own flash cards; you can work with classmates to divide up the duties\n- [Google Tasks and Calendar](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/)\n\n## ## ## Limiting Distractions\n- [Freedom](http://macfreedom.com/) — many people swear by this program, available for MacOS, Windows, and Android ($10)\n- [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji) — for Google Chrome\n- LeechBlock — for Firefox\n- [MeeTimer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/meetimer/) — for Firefox; tracks and logs where you spend your time\n\n######Cheering Yourself and Others\n- [43 Things](http://www.43things.com/) — a goal-setting site\n- [StickK](http://www.stickk.com/) — a goal-setting site\n- [Coffitivity](http://coffitivity.com/) — modest background noise similar to a coffee shop\n\n\n## Recommended books by the author:\n- [Calculus Made Easy](http://amzn.to/2i0JZMq) - Silvanus Thompson\n- [The Click Moment](http://amzn.to/2vE2uJU) - Frans Johansson\n- [Stalling for Time](http://amzn.to/2fHierH)- FBI hostage negotiator Gary Noesner\n- [The Power of Habit](http://amzn.to/2uEuiAD) - Charles Duhigg\n- [Buddha in Blue Jeans](http://amzn.to/2vzvQe5) - Tai Sheridan\n- [Getting things done](http://amzn.to/2fG2tRy) - David Allen\n- [The Now Habit](http://amzn.to/2w55uSB) - Neil Fiore\n\nIf you found these notes useful, stack up your karma points and share this with others, and if you want to dive deeper, you can [get it here](http://amzn.to/2vDVzk1)\n",

Have someone **ask** you \"how do you know that?\"\n(Ask yourself if there's no one around you can do this with)\n\n3. **Pour** everything that comes to mind, UNFILTERED\n\n4.

If you haven’t done so already, [read this short SO](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) post about how to ask good questions as well. If you already read it, [go over it again quickly](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).\n \nCommunication is one of the most important skills an effective developer (and any human being actually) can posses. \n \nAs you learn to communicate effectively and clearly with others, your internal communication (read: \"thinking\") will start to improve as well in ways you might not fully comprehend yet it will surprise you as it happens, now ...\n \nWhenever communicating to me (and other devs), remember these pointers:\n\n---\n\n###### Big picture first, little pieces last\nSaying “when I click the ‘next’ arrow it jumps too much forward” doesn’t tell me much until I know what you are trying to implement is pagination. It’s better to start with:\n“I’m implementing pagination in the books table”, and THEN go on to the little details, “When I click the “next” arrow…”\n\n---\n\n###### Be specific, state current and wanted behavior\n“It jumps too much forward” could mean many things. It’s better to state EXACTLY what happens NOW, and what SHOULD happen, i.e.:\n \n“Current behavior: While on page 1, clicking the next arrow fetches the data of page 3, and highlights the number 3 in the page selector.\n \nWanted behavior: While on page 1, clicking the next arrow should fetch the data of page 2, and highlight the number 2 in the page selector.”\n \nThis way there’s (almost) ZERO room for miscommunication, and I know exactly what the problem is and what we want to achieve.\n \n(do your best to) **Include the following**:  \n\n1. What did you research to solve the problem\n\n2. What have you tried\n\n3. Copy paste of the error, if any\n\n4. Screenshot of the problem if possible, I use [nimbus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nimbus-screenshot-screen/bpconcjcammlapcogcnnelfmaeghhagj)\n\n5. What’s the current behavior\n\n6. What’s the wanted behavior\n\n7. Link to the repo when possible, or [gist](http://gist.github.com/new) with any relevant code.\n\n8. This is programming, be specific!

Of coure comprehension is an elusive anstract word, so good luck with that, it's just an indicator :)\n  - phase 1 - 250 wpm\n  - phase 2 - 350 wpm\n  - phase 3 - 500 wpm\n  - phase 4 - 700 wpm\n  - phase 5 - 1000 wpm\n  - phase 6 - 1250 wpm\n  - phase 7 - 1500 wpm\n- **Remember** [Mario's quote](/quotes-i-love/)\n- **Plateau hack**\n  - If your stuck on 500 wpm, read a few pages at 1500 wpm\n  - Reread the same pages at 1500 wpm for a few times\n  - And then go to 600 wpm\n\n#### Misc\n- **Deeper and longer understanding** for a specific subject\n  - Mind mapping\n  - Memory palace/temple\n  - Memorize numbers with stories and marker system\n  - Meh. I use the [this system](http://www.memorizeeverything.com/core_skills/numbers/) instead\n- **Sleep**\n  - Healthy sleep is importnat (you don't say ...)\n  - Naps\n  - Practicing learning faster and deeper can drain you at times.\n  - Memory/power naps can help, up to 26 minutes (otherwise we get into deep sleep)\n- **State based learning**\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oYgN-m8Q5yE?modestbranding=1&rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  - If u'll have a test in a noisy place, study in a noisy enviornment\n  \n- [Coffee](/blog/coffee/) is okay!\n\n- [Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)\n\n- dense material (law, medicine, etc)\n  - emphasis on pre read, creating curiousity and think about applications for the material\n\n#### Languages\n- Classroom is a terribly inefficient place to learn\n- Don't translate words, connect to direct sensory experience\n- Learn in the real word, real scenarios\n- Use [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and upload images to words\n\n#### Remember names\n- Link to another person you know with same name\n- Notice what stands out in the person and tie the name to that\n- Nonenglish names, break to words\n  - Samoon -> Sam + Moon\n\n#### Limiting beliefs\nMany people who read this page tell me it's sounds good BUT they will never make it because ...\n- \"I'm not smart enough\"\n- \"I'm diagnosed with ...\"\n- \"That's true for OTHERS, but it will never work on me ...\"\n\n... If your one of said people, fret not!\n\n[do this first](/tools/internal-dialog-scrambler/), and [talk to me](/lets-talk/)!\n\nShould you [buy it](https://www.udemy.com/become-a-superlearner-2-speed-reading-memory-accelerated-learning/)? If some of those concepts are new to you, and you prefer to save time researching them yourself, I'd say go ahead and buy it. I got very limited benefits from this course but I've been into speed learning for years now, so if your new, check it out.\n\nThe dude presenting the course seems sweet and genuine, trying to be professional and \"human\" at the same time, which always gets a giggle out of me (u know by now [how \"professional\" and \"serious\" I can get](/who-am-i-anyway/) at times ...)\n",

Feeling lonely most of the time, even when laughing with friends and family it's still pretty much empty.\n\n2. hate my body, no matter how much compliments I get I think I'm ugly and unattractive, and would never be.\n\n3. jealous of my big brother. Everything comes so easy to him, as I suffer my pathetic existence\n\n4. Future freaks me out. I have no motivation to do anything, but I'm afraid to miss out on life and the polarity drives me nuts.\n\n5. I feel like I'm a burden on my family, which try to help but keep making things worse, and it makes me feel like I'm MORE of a burden. Fuckign vicious cycle.\n\n6. I can barely sleep. Once every couple of days I might get away with more than 2-3 straight hours\n\n7. My stomach hurts. A LOT. throughout the day AND when I'm in the bathroom (which is quite often, and each episode is long)\n\n8. I feel I don't belong to my family, or anywhere else for that matter. I don't relate to friends in school,\nand through most social gathering I just sit and hope no one would bother me.\n\n9. I hate my life, but at the same time I KNOW life could be great. It would be such a waste to end it all. I just know there is a solution, and I'm actively looking for one.\n\n(I've tried acupuncture, meditation, psychology, different kinds of \"experts\" and \"professionals\", exercise, martial arts, reading books, nothing helped yet)\n\nTo me, when I've done this way back some 10 years ago, it really helped me think clearer.\n\nLife was still shit, but it was a bit more organised shit, you know?\n\nRemember we are still in GATHERING INFORMATION phase.\n\nIf you catch your internal dialog going \"I don't understand how this will make me feel better\", that's your brain tricking you the stay in what's familiar, instead of [experiencing](/blind-cheryl-learns-about-colors/) something new and wonderful first, and THEN understand.\n\nWhile it does provide a new perspective for many people I've shown this to, the main point of this is to gather and sort information so we will know where to intervene next to induce a stronger change.\n",
